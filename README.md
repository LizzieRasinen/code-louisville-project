Behind the Seams

My Code Louisville September project is a basic website for a friend's alterations business.  It has a brief description of the types of alterations
she provides, along with an appointment request form.  It has one set of media queries for mobile switching which flex boxes that are visible as well as a 3 bar navigation menu that changes to an "x" when clicked.  It has 2 additional sets of media queries for tablet and desktop as well.  Flexbox order changes between sizes, as well as what flexboxes are visible.  Java script was used twice, once for the nav bar in mobile and also for the submit form for appointment request. I hope this finally works in git hub.


Requirements:
2 Media Queries:
Mobile, tablet and computer screen each have a slightly different layout and nav bar.
Have the minimum of 5 commits in Github.
README file
Java Script being used to hide/show navigation info for hamburger icon.
Flexbox to rearrange for computer screen.
